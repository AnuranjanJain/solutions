# Diameter Of Binary Tree

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].


Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution Approach

This problem is solved using a binary search approach. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Initialize left and right pointers to the start and end of the array.
2. While left <= right, compute the middle index.
3. Compare the middle element with the target value.
4. If the middle element equals the target, return the index.
5. If the middle element is greater than the target, search the left half.
6. If the middle element is less than the target, search the right half.
7. If the element is not found, return an appropriate indicator.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root):
        def diameter(node, res):
            if not node:
                return 0

            left = diameter(node.left, res)
            right = diameter(node.right, res)

            res[0] = max(res[0], left + right)

            return max(left, right) + 1

        res = [0]

        diameter(root, res)
    
        return res[0]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) where n is the size of the input array. Binary search divides the search space in half with each step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space is used.

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A linear search approach could also work but would be less efficient with O(n) time complexity.
- A hash map could provide O(1) lookups but requires O(n) space and preprocessing time.


## Key Takeaways

- Binary search is most effective on sorted data and reduces the search space by half in each step.
- Always check boundary conditions and how to handle duplicates when implementing binary search.
- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
