# Happy Number

## Problem Description

Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:


	Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
	Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
	Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.


Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


Example 2:


Input: n = 2
Output: false


 
Constraints:


	1 <= n <= 231 - 1

## Problem Details

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/
- **Topics:** Hash Table, Math, Two Pointers

## Solution Approach

This problem is solved using careful iteration through the input. The solution tracks necessary values and builds the result incrementally.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1:
            n = sum(int(c)**2 for c in str(n))
            if n in seen:
                return False
            seen.add(n)
        return True
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
