# Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]


Example 2:


Input: root = [1]
Output: [[1]]


Example 3:


Input: root = []
Output: []


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000].
	-100 <= Node.val <= 100

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.

4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def zigzagLevelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        q = collections.deque()
        q.append(root)

        if not root:
            return res
        while q:
            level = []
            for _ in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
                level.append(node.val)
            
            if len(res) % 2 == 0:
                res.append(level)
            else:
                res.append(level[::-1])
        return res
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
