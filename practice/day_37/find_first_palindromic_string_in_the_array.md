# Find First Palindromic String In The Array

## Problem Description

Given an array of strings words, return the first palindromic string in the array. If there is no such string, return an empty string "".

A string is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.

 
Example 1:


Input: words = ["abc","car","ada","racecar","cool"]
Output: "ada"
Explanation: The first string that is palindromic is "ada".
Note that "racecar" is also palindromic, but it is not the first.


Example 2:


Input: words = ["notapalindrome","racecar"]
Output: "racecar"
Explanation: The first and only string that is palindromic is "racecar".


Example 3:


Input: words = ["def","ghi"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There are no palindromic strings, so the empty string is returned.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= words.length <= 100
	1 <= words[i].length <= 100
	words[i] consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def check(self, s: str) -> bool:
        i, j = 0, len(s) - 1
        while i <= j:
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                i += 1
                j -= 1
            else:
                return False
        return True
    
    def firstPalindrome(self, words: List[str]) -> str:
        for word in words:
            if self.check(word):
                return word
        return ""
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
