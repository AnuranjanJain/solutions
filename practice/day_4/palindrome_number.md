# Palindrome Number

## Problem Description

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 
Example 1:


Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.


Example 2:


Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


Example 3:


Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


 
Constraints:


	-231 <= x <= 231 - 1


 
Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

- **Topics:** Math

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.

4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        y=str(x)
        y=y[::-1]
        if str(x)==str(y):
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
