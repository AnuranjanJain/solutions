# Reverse Integer

## Problem Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

 
Example 1:


Input: x = 123
Output: 321


Example 2:


Input: x = -123
Output: -321


Example 3:


Input: x = 120
Output: 21


 
Constraints:


	-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
