# Maximum Number Of Vowels In A Substring Of Given Length

## Problem Description

Given a string s and an integer k, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of s with length k.

Vowel letters in English are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "abciiidef", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring "iii" contains 3 vowel letters.


Example 2:


Input: s = "aeiou", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: Any substring of length 2 contains 2 vowels.


Example 3:


Input: s = "leetcode", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: "lee", "eet" and "ode" contain 2 vowels.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 105
	s consists of lowercase English letters.
	1 <= k <= s.length

## Solution Approach

This problem is solved using careful iteration through the input. The solution tracks necessary values and builds the result incrementally.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        vowels = frozenset("aeiou")
        cnt = ans = sum(s[i] in vowels for i in range(k))
        if ans != k:
            for i in range(k, len(s)):
                cnt += (s[i] in vowels) - (s[i - k] in vowels)
                ans = max(cnt, ans)
        return ans
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n is the size of the input, due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
