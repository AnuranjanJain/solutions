# Implement Stack Using Queues

## Problem Description

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyStack class:


	void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
	int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
	int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
	boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.


Notes:


	You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
	Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.


 
Example 1:


Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False


 
Constraints:


	1 <= x <= 9
	At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
	All the calls to pop and top are valid.


 
Follow-up: Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

## Problem Details

- **URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/description/
- **Topics:** Stack, Design, Queue

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
from collections import deque
class MyStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.q1 = deque()
        self.q2 = deque()

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.q2.append(x)
        while self.q1:
            self.q2.append(self.q1.popleft())
        self.q1, self.q2 = self.q2, self.q1

    def pop(self) -> int:
        return self.q1.popleft()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.q1[0]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self.q1) == 0


# Your MyStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyStack()
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.empty()
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
