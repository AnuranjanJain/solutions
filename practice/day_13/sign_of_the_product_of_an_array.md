# Sign Of The Product Of An Array

## Problem Description

Implement a function signFunc(x) that returns:


	1 if x is positive.
	-1 if x is negative.
	0 if x is equal to 0.


You are given an integer array nums. Let product be the product of all values in the array nums.

Return signFunc(product).

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is 144, and signFunc(144) = 1


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is 0, and signFunc(0) = 0


Example 3:


Input: nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]
Output: -1
Explanation: The product of all values in the array is -1, and signFunc(-1) = -1


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	-100 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def arraySign(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        prd=1
        for num in nums:
            if num==0:
                prd=0
            else:
                prd=num*prd
        def signFunc(num):
            if num<0:
                return -1
            elif num==0:
                return 0
            else:
                return 1
        return signFunc(prd)
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
