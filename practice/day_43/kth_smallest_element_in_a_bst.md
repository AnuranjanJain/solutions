# Kth Smallest Element In A Bst

## Problem Description

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1


Example 2:


Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is n.
	1 <= k <= n <= 104
	0 <= Node.val <= 104


 
Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.

4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        smallest=[]
        def transverse(root):
            if root==None: return 
            left=transverse(root.left)
            smallest.append(root.val)
            right=transverse(root.right)
        transverse(root)
        return smallest[k-1]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
