# Zigzag Conversion

## Problem Description

The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)


P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R


And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:


string convert(string s, int numRows);


 
Example 1:


Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"


Example 2:


Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I


Example 3:


Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 1000
	s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
	1 <= numRows <= 1000

- **Topics:** String

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1: return s
        a=""
        for i in range(numRows):
            for j in range(i,len(s),2*(numRows-1)):
                a+=s[j]
                if(i>0 and i<numRows-1 and j+2*(numRows-1)-2*i < len(s)):
                    a+=s[j+2*(numRows-1)-2*i]
        return a
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n is the size of the input, due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
