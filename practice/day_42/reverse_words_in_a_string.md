# Reverse Words In A String

## Problem Description

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 
Example 1:


Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"


Example 2:


Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


Example 3:


Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= s.length <= 104
	s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
	There is at least one word in s.


 
Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        val=list(s.split())
        return " ".join(val[::-1])
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
