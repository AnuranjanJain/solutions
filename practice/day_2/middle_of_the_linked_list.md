# Middle Of The Linked List

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

 
Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.


Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
	1 <= Node.val <= 100

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def middleNode(self, head):
        """
        :type head: Optional[ListNode]
        :rtype: Optional[ListNode]
        """
        values = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            values.append(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next

        sliced = values[len(values)//2 :]

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy
        for val in sliced:
            curr.next = ListNode(val)
            curr = curr.next

        return dummy.next
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
