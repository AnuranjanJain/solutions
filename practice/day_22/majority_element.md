# Majority Element

## Problem Description

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

 
Constraints:


	n == nums.length
	1 <= n <= 5 * 104
	-109 <= nums[i] <= 109


 
Follow-up: Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        return nums[len(nums) // 2]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.
