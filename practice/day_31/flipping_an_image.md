# Flipping An Image

## Problem Description

Given an n x n binary matrix image, flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.


	For example, flipping [1,1,0] horizontally results in [0,1,1].


To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0.


	For example, inverting [0,1,1] results in [1,0,0].


 
Example 1:


Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]


Example 2:


Input: image = [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]


 
Constraints:


	n == image.length
	n == image[i].length
	1 <= n <= 20
	images[i][j] is either 0 or 1.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def flipAndInvertImage(self, image: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        def flip(arr):
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                arr[i]=arr[i][::-1]
        def invert(arr):
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                for j in range(len(arr[0])):
                    if arr[i][j]==0:
                        arr[i][j]=1
                    else:
                        arr[i][j]=0

        flip(image)
        invert(image)
        return image
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n is the size of the input, due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
