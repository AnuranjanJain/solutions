# Check If It Is A Good Array

## Problem Description

Given an array nums of positive integers. Your task is to select some subset of nums, multiply each element by an integer and add all these numbers. The array is said to be good if you can obtain a sum of 1 from the array by any possible subset and multiplicand.

Return True if the array is good otherwise return False.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [12,5,7,23]
Output: true
Explanation: Pick numbers 5 and 7.
5*3 + 7*(-2) = 1


Example 2:


Input: nums = [29,6,10]
Output: true
Explanation: Pick numbers 29, 6 and 10.
29*1 + 6*(-3) + 10*(-1) = 1


Example 3:


Input: nums = [3,6]
Output: false


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
	1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

- **Topics:** Array, Math, Number Theory

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
from math import gcd
class Solution:
    def isGoodArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        x = 0
        for num in nums:
            x = gcd(x, num)
        return True if x == 1 else False
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
