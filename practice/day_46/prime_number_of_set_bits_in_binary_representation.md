# Prime Number Of Set Bits In Binary Representation

## Problem Description

Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.


	For example, 21 written in binary is 10101, which has 3 set bits.


 
Example 1:


Input: left = 6, right = 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
6  -> 110 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
7  -> 111 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
8  -> 1000 (1 set bit, 1 is not prime)
9  -> 1001 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
4 numbers have a prime number of set bits.


Example 2:


Input: left = 10, right = 15
Output: 5
Explanation:
10 -> 1010 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
11 -> 1011 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
12 -> 1100 (2 set bits, 2 is prime)
13 -> 1101 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
14 -> 1110 (3 set bits, 3 is prime)
15 -> 1111 (4 set bits, 4 is not prime)
5 numbers have a prime number of set bits.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= left <= right <= 106
	0 <= right - left <= 104

## Solution Approach

This problem is solved using careful iteration through the input. The solution tracks necessary values and builds the result incrementally.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def countPrimeSetBits(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        count=0
    
        def find_prime(value):
            p = 2
            if value == 1:
                return False
            if value == 2:
                return True
            while p<=int(sqrt(value))+1:
                if value%p == 0:
                    return False
                p+=1
            return True
            
        for i in range(left,right+1):
            a = bin(i)[2:]
            one = a.count('1')
            if find_prime(one):
                count+=1
        return count
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
