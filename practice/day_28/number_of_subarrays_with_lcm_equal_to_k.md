# Number Of Subarrays With Lcm Equal To K

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays of nums where the least common multiple of the subarray's elements is k.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

The least common multiple of an array is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the array elements.

 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [3,6,2,7,1], k = 6
Output: 4
Explanation: The subarrays of nums where 6 is the least common multiple of all the subarray's elements are:
- [3,6,2,7,1]
- [3,6,2,7,1]
- [3,6,2,7,1]
- [3,6,2,7,1]


Example 2:


Input: nums = [3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no subarrays of nums where 2 is the least common multiple of all the subarray's elements.


 
Constraints:


	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	1 <= nums[i], k <= 1000

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def subarrayLCM(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def find_lcm(a, b):
            return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        c=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            l=nums[i]
            if l==k:
                c+=1
            if l>k:
                continue
            for j in range(i+1,len(nums)):
                l=find_lcm(l,nums[j])
                if l==k:
                    c+=1
                if l>k:
                    break
        return c
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) where n is the size of the input, due to the nested loops.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
