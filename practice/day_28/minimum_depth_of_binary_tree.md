# Minimum Depth Of Binary Tree

## Problem Description

Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.

The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 2


Example 2:


Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
Output: 5


 
Constraints:


	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 105].
	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## Solution Approach

This problem requires a methodical approach to handle different cases and edge conditions. The solution implements a careful algorithm to process the input efficiently.

## Step-by-Step Explanation

1. Analyze the problem requirements and edge cases.
2. Choose appropriate data structures for efficient operations.
3. Implement the core algorithm to process the input.
4. Handle edge cases and specific conditions.
5. Optimize the solution for better performance.
6. Build and return the required result.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Solution(object):
    def minDepth(self, root):
        
        if root is None:  return 0

        leftDepth = self.minDepth(root.left)
        rightDepth = self.minDepth(root.right)

        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return 1

        if root.left is None:
            return 1 + rightDepth

        if root.right is None:
            return 1 + leftDepth

        return min(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the size of the input
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) constant extra space

## Optimizations and Alternatives

- A more space-efficient approach might be possible by optimizing the data structures used.
- A different algorithm paradigm (like divide-and-conquer or greedy) could provide a valid solution with different trade-offs.


## Key Takeaways

- Breaking down the problem into smaller steps often leads to a clearer solution.
- Consider the trade-offs between time complexity, space complexity, and code readability.
